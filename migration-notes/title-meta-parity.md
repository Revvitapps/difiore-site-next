# Title & Meta Parity Check (Legacy vs. Next.js)

Source crawl: `Old site Seo/crawl` (captured from the GoDaddy site).

| Path | Legacy Title | Current Title | Notes |
| ---- | ------------- | ------------- | ----- |
| `/` | `DiFiore Builders Inc.` | `Home Remodeling, Roofing & Additions \| DiFiore Builders – Tri-State Area` | Current title injects service keywords; legacy was brand-only. Legacy H1: “Welcome To DiFiore Builders Inc.” vs. current hero heading “The DiFiore Difference.” |
| `/our-story` | `Our Story` | `Our Story \| Family-Owned General Contractor Since 2003` | Enriched with value prop; acceptable to keep. Legacy H1: “Trusted and verified.” |
| `/services` | `Services` | `Services` | Matches legacy. Description already mirrors legacy paragraph. |
| `/before-and-after` | `Before and After` | `Before & After Project Gallery \| DiFiore Builders` | Adds “Project Gallery” for clarity. Legacy H1 “APARTMENT RENOVATION” came from the old template; we now use “Before & After.” |
| `/our-projects` | `Our Projects` | `Our Projects` | Title unchanged. Current meta adds a concise summary where the legacy page had none. |

**Recommendation:** keep the upgraded titles/headers for launch (they introduce useful intent keywords) and retain the legacy wording in this doc for reference. If strict parity is required, revert the homepage title/H1 to the legacy copy before cutover.
